## Entry Point

**Desktop Entry:** `client/src/App.tsx` (Prompt Forge UI - 505 lines)  
**Desktop Component:** `client/src/components/desktop/Desktop.tsx`

---

## Current State

**Foundation:**
- ✅ Framework 8 architecture validated (Aries + Loki audits)
- ✅ Enforcement core separation intact
- ✅ Safe migrations confirmed
- ✅ Loki → Aries trust chain verified

**Migrations Complete:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Window system (spatial semantics)
- ✅ Phase 2: Design system (tokens)
- ✅ Phase 3: Desktop container
- ✅ Build: PASSES

**Pending:**
- ⏳ GitHub push (authentication needed)
- ⏳ Make shell usable (windows open/move/close)
- ⏳ Public surface (xi-io.com) deployment

---

## Priority Order

### Priority 1: Establish ONE canonical shipped surface
- ✅ Alpaca repo after Phase 1-3 migrations
- ✅ Running locally
- ⏳ Mirrored to GitHub (push pending)
- ⏳ Deployed to xi-io.com

### Priority 2: Make shell usable by you
- Windows open
- Windows move
- Windows close
- Folders/stacks behave
- Clean SVG icons, single-color
- Intentional typography and color

**Target:** Windows XP-level functionality with your visual discipline.

### Priority 3: Freeze enforcement + identity changes
**DO NOT TOUCH:**
- Enforcement core
- Identity anchoring
- Ledger logic
- CSP rules
- Dotfile invariants

They're doing their job. Let them be boring.

## Next Work

**Construction paper layer first:**
- Usable, not beautiful
- Functional, not perfect
- Proves you can still ship
- Architecture is embodied
- System can build itself forward

**Glass later. Underworld last.**

---

## Validation

**Aries + Loki confirmation:**
- Foundation is already poured
- No re-architecture needed
- Stabilize and surface
- Keep shipping

---

**Status:** ✅ **READY TO BUILD THE HOUSE**
