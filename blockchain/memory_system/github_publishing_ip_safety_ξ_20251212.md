# GitHub Publishing & IP Safety — Blockchain Record

**DATE:** 2025-12-12  
**HASH:** `ξ_github_publishing_ip_safety_20251212`  
**SOURCE:** ChatGPT Architectural Review  
**STATUS:** 🔒 LOCKED — Permanent Record

## Core Correction (Locked)

**Enforcement is code-enforced, not "process-enforced."**

The sprint/constraint/governance substrate is **real machinery**, not aspirational documentation.

---

## Publication Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **Treat GitHub as a window, not the house.**

**Publish:**
- Interfaces
- Shells
- Adapters
- UI primitives
- Examples
- Device chrome
- Theme tokens
- Demos

**Keep Private:**
- Deep orchestration logic
- Policy executor
- Enforcement core
- Sprint system
- Constraint engine
- AI governance substrate

---

## Pre-Publication Checklist (Mandatory)

### 1. Create Private "System Anatomy" Document

**Contents:**
- Subsystems inventory
- Authority boundaries
- Violation prevention mechanisms
- Failure modes
- Enforcement points

**Purpose:** Self-defense documentation (not for GitHub, not for users)

---

### 2. Classify Code into Tiers

**Public-Safe:**
- UI primitives
- Device chrome
- Theme tokens
- Demos
- Examples

**Partner-Only:**
- Integration glue
- Automation harness
- API adapters

**Private-Core:**
- Policy engine
- Sprint executor
- Constraint system
- AI governance machinery
- Enforcement substrate

---

### 3. Decide IP Posture (Choose One or Combination)

**Option A: Defensive Publication**
- Publish enough to prevent others from patenting around you
- Creates prior art
- Prevents patent blocking

**Option B: Provisional Patent**
- File provisional (cheap, quiet)
- Freezes priority while building
- 12-month window to file full patent

**Option C: Trade-Secret-by-Architecture**
- Keep core private
- Publish shells only
- System only works when all parts align
- Copying one part is useless

**Current Status:** Closest to Option C (architecture-based protection)

---

### 4. Security Non-Negotiables

**Immediate Actions:**
- ✅ Enable 2FA on GitHub account
- ✅ Branch protection on `main`
- ✅ Require PRs (even if just you)
- ✅ Enable GitHub Secret Scanning
- ✅ Enable Dependabot alerts
- ✅ Least-privilege collaborators

**Never Commit:**
- ❌ Keys/tokens
- ❌ USB patterns
- ❌ Private data paths
- ❌ `.env` files
- ❌ Credentials (even if deleted later — git history remembers)

**Use Instead:**
- `.env.example` with fake values
- Secret management system
- Rotate anything that touched a repo

---

## Repository Security Model

**Private Repo = Low Visibility, Not Impossible to Leak**

**Protection Layers:**
1. Private repo (first line)
2. Code-enforced constraints (second line)
3. Architecture-based protection (third line)
4. Legal/IP posture (fourth line)

**Split Strategy:**
- Keep "AI governance/sprint executor/enforcement core" in **separate private repo** (or private submodule)
- Publish "habitat shell" repo publicly
- Only connect via well-defined interfaces

---

## The Real Invention

**Not React. Not UI. Not even AI.**

**The invention is:**
> *A user-governed, constraint-driven, locally-enforced AI orchestration system that treats autonomy as illegal by default.*

**Why This Matters:**
- Enforcement system itself is the IP
- Local-first architecture
- Enforcement does not depend on cloud secrecy
- Users custody their own data
- AI is not trusted with raw power

**Risk Profile:**
- Publishing *parts* does not reveal the whole
- Copying code without philosophy + enforcement yields broken clone
- Value lives in **composition**, not fragments

---

## GitHub Repository

**URL:** `https://github.com/Vado42-chris/00_xibalba_framework_blockchain`

**Status:** Private (as of 2025-12-12)

**Initial Publication:**
- Guardrails only (UI_BRIEF.md, DO_NOT_TOUCH.md, WORKFLOW.md)
- Build system (client/, server/)
- No enforcement core
- No sprint system
- No policy executor

---

## Next Steps (Locked)

1. ✅ Record this memo in blockchain
2. ⏳ Complete GitHub push (after authentication)
3. ⏳ Create System Anatomy document (private)
4. ⏳ Classify all code into tiers
5. ⏳ Decide final IP posture
6. ⏳ Enable all security protections
7. ⏳ Split core vs. shell repos (if needed)

---

## Historical Context

**This record establishes:**
- Framework 8's publication strategy
- IP protection approach
- Security baseline
- Enforcement architecture recognition

**This is not policy. This is architecture.**
