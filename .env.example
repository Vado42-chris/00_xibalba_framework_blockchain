# Example environment variables for local development
# Copy this file to .env and edit values as needed.
#
# Security:
# - Do NOT commit real secrets to the repository.
# - Use a secrets manager or CI secrets for production.
# - In local dev you can set short-lived test tokens if needed.

# API settings
API_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_PORT=8001
# Full API URL used by worker and clients. If you change host/port above, update this.
API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001

# Worker identity & auth
# A short unique id for this worker instance.
WORKER_ID=local1
# Optional secret header the worker will send to the API: X-WORKER-SECRET
# If your control plane enforces a worker secret, set it here.
# Leave blank for local dev.
WORKER_SECRET=

# Hybrid file-queue settings
# Directory/file-queue names (when running on host, the worker writes to hybrid-queue
# and reads results from hybrid-results). With docker-compose these are bind mounts.
HYBRID_QUEUE=hybrid-queue
HYBRID_RESULTS=hybrid-results

# If you want the worker to include a per-job SECRET_TOKEN in the .cmd file
# (hybrid-agent should verify this token before executing handoffs).
HYBRID_SECRET=

# Runtime preferences
# Preferred runtime for jobs that support more than one option (e.g. container vs local)
RUNTIME_PREF=container

# Timeouts and polling (seconds)
# How frequently the worker polls the API for new jobs / checks hybrid-results
POLL_INTERVAL=2
# How often to batch and send log lines back to API (seconds)
LOG_BATCH_SECONDS=1
# Default HTTP request timeout used by worker when calling the API
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=15

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_DIR=logs

# Development helpers
# Enable the worker to actually execute commands locally (dev only).
# When HYBRID_QUEUE/HYBRID_RESULTS are empty the worker falls back to local execution.
ENABLE_LOCAL_EXEC=true

# Example credentials for API authentication (if your API requires auth for job submissions)
# For production, use proper OAuth/JWT or API keys stored in secret stores.
